            <h3>static array</h3>
            <h4>  The size of a static array is fixed at compile time. Memory for a static array is allocated on the stack or in the data segment of the program.
                Dynamic Array: The size of a dynamic array can be determined and changed at runtime. Memory for a dynamic array is allocated on the heap.
                Size Flexibility:

                <p>Static Array: Once defined, the size of a static array cannot be changed during program execution.
                    Dynamic Array: Dynamic arrays can grow or shrink in size dynamically during runtime by reallocating memory as needed.
                    Access and Efficiency:
                    
                    Static Array: Accessing elements in a static array is generally faster because elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.
                    Dynamic Array: Accessing elements in a dynamic array might be slightly slower due to potential indirection through pointers and memory allocation overhead.
                    Usage and Flexibility:
                    
                    Static Array: Suitable for situations where the size of the array is known at compile time and does not change frequently.
                    Dynamic Array: Ideal for situations where the size of the array is unknown at compile time or needs to change dynamically during program execution.
                    Initialization and Destruction:
                    
                    Static Array: Initialization typically happens at compile time or runtime, and destruction occurs automatically when the array goes out of scope.
                    Dynamic Array: Initialization and destruction are managed explicitly by the programmer using functions like malloc, calloc, realloc, and free.
                    Error Handling:
                    
                    Static Array: Errors related to size limitations (e.g., buffer overflow) might occur at compile time or runtime.
                    Dynamic Array: Errors such as out-of-memory conditions can occur during runtime when attempting to resize or allocate memory.
                    In summary, static arrays are fixed in size and allocated at compile time, while dynamic arrays can change in size at runtime and are allocated on the heap. Dynamic arrays provide more flexibility but require manual memory management and might incur slightly more overhead compared to static arrays.</p>
